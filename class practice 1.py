#classes are about object oriented programiing
#in which all coding are code in a proper way
#example
#the sets of function are place at one place
#the set of variables are place at one class
#classes allows us to group our dataa logically and easy to use and ascess or build upon it
#note object means instances

#here going to build a class for a company which store empolyee(name, id ,adress of camp, and function
#which a employee will perform

class mycopmany:
    pass       #idk what is the purpose of this pass
empolyee1=mycopmany
#empolyee1("faeukh",4567,"comouter science","peshawar") #error object .....

#to creat an object of a singal empolyee is default thing without a function
empolyee1.name="farukh"
empolyee1.id=342
empolyee1.baranch="computer science"
empolyee1.adress="peshawar"

#to print a singal empoylee information with a function is a defauclt thing

print(empolyee1)
print(empolyee1.name) #empolye1 is an object and name is an attribute
print(empolyee1.id)    #id , branch and adress are attribute of the object(employee 1)
print(empolyee1.baranch)
print(empolyee1.adress)
